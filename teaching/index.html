<blockquote>
  <p>We asked around and friends recommended Fraser to tutor our son in Grade 11 Math. After the first visit our son told us that he was finally learning the concepts. By the end of the semester he had a whole new confidence and outlook about math. Fraser has a kind and calm demeanour and a respectful way of teaching a struggling 16 year old. Next year our son starts first year of a university business degree and is excited to tackle the math courses.</p>

<p>Are you or your child struggling in high school math or physics, or just trying to get a head start? I can help! I’ve spent 5 years teaching math and physics to Ontario high school students as a private tutor, and to undergrads as a teaching assistant. Of the 17 long-term private tutoring clients I’ve worked with, all have reported improved grades, confidence, and interest in these subjects.</p>

<p>I’ve hit my share of roadblocks in physics and math over the years, and I’ve developed a set of learning skills to navigate them. Beyond the concepts themselves, I teach my clients how to study efficiently, ask useful questions, think critically, and communicate their results effectively.</p>

<p>If you’d like to arrange a free Zoom consultation to determine if we’ll be a good fit, please <a href="/contact/">contact me!</a></p>

<h3 id="what-youre-paying-for">What you’re paying for</h3>
<p>This service is more than <em>homework help</em> or <em>test preparation</em>. I work to instill an intuitive understanding of these topics, and help develop the learning techniques necessary to succeed in future courses. My teaching strategy is based on three pillars:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Identifying the gaps.</strong> Using a set of diagnostic tools including collaborative problem solving, I identify the fundamental concepts the student is struggling with. In the hundreds of students I’ve worked with as a tutor and TA, I’ve seen the common pitfalls and points of confusion in these topics. I’ve even experienced many of them myself!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Teaching through dialogue.</strong> I design custom lesson plans for each student, to address their specific learning needs. In each session, we work through a series of problems selected to develop conceptual understanding and problem-solving skills. At each step in the process, I make sure the student is able to fully explain their reasoning, and report their solutions in a way that will be satisfactory on tests and assignments.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Practice, practice, practice!</strong> The most important part of learning physics and math is independent practice. Following each session, I send the student a set of practice problems curated to reinforce what was discussed. Sometimes these problems will be from external online resources, but in cases where a specific learning gap needs to be addressed, I create custom problem sets and solutions.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<!-- 
> Fraser began working with my son as he entered his first year of high school. From the outset, Fraser explained that he focuses on teaching not just how to complete the curriculum, but why it is important and how one concept connects to other concepts. His style is low key, effective and conducive to asking questions. The focus is as much on building problem solving skills as it is on developing learning skills. The results go beyond improvements in grades. It has led to a noticeable improvement in my son’s learning skills and confidence in his approach to school. Fraser utilizes technology effortlessly into his lessons, using virtual whiteboards to illustrate ideas and answer questions. Our experience has been very positive and highly recommended Fraser’s expertise.
